Code Challenge

Regarding the Code Challenge, I have made an app using JavaScript, Node.JS and its libraries mainly EJS, nodemon, method-Override and mongoose. I have implemented RESTful routes and used Mongodb as a database. It is a CRUD application, also i have implemented search option in which one can search and get the result on the basis of the name of entry. I can add more filters to the search if you want.

How to run

First Clone the repo and download it to your local system.

Install the dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies by opening terminal.

  npm install
Next run the following command to get the server up and running

  nodemon index.js
The server would be running at http://localhost:3000/ now.
