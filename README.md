# Code Challenge



 Regarding the Code Challenge, I have made an app using JavaScript, Node.JS and its libraries mainly EJS, nodemon, method-Override and mongoose. I have implemented RESTful routes and used Mongodb as a database.


## How to run

First Clone the repo and download it to your local system.
## Install the dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies by opening terminal.

```bash
  npm install
```
Next run the following command to get the server up and running

```bash
  nodemon index.js
```

The server would be running at http://localhost:3000/ now.
